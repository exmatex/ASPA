Example of ASPA usage:
=====================

Files:
======
Makefile         - 
README           - This file.
aspa.inp         - Input file for the test problem.
main.cc          - Main driver for the test poblem.
point_data.txt   - Input point data.
value_data.txt   - Input value data.

Compilation:
============

The build is performed by setting the following macros in the Makefile

Macro          Meaning                 Example

CXX            C++ compiler            CXX = g++
CXXFLAGS       Compiler options        CXXFLAGS = -O2
LAPACK_LOC     LAPACK library location LAPACK_LOC = /usr/local/lib/lapack
BLAS_LOC       BLAS library location   BLAS_LOC = $(LAPACK_LOC)
HDF5_LOC       HDF5 library location   HDF5_LOC = /usr/local/lib/hdf5-gnu-1.8.5

and then typing

$ gmake 

on the command line. The resulting executable is aspa.

Execution:
==========

The test example is executed as

$ ./aspa point_data.txt value_data.txt

The input parameters are read from aspa.inp.
